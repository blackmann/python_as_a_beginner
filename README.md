python_as_a_beginner
====================

Being a PyBeginner, these are useful(to me) codes I wrote as to solutions for some online excercises
Hope looking through gives you an insight and ideas to solve some problems.
As of this moment I am using an Android phone to write and test codes! :)
I ain't happy about using a phone but happy of writting sensible codes.
Enjoy!
